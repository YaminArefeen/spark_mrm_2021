# Code to Replicate Figures in "Scan-Specific Artifact Reduction in K-space (SPARK) Neural Networks Syngerize with Physics-based Reconstruction to Accelerate "MRI"

SPARK trains a convolutional-neural-network to estimate k-space errors made by an input reconstruction technique by back-propagating from the mean-squared-error loss between an auto-calibration signal (ACS) and the input techniqueâ€™s reconstructed ACS.  In this repository, we provide the code and data used to generate Figures 4-9.  The associated data for Figures 6-9 can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zveq2tfh7mgr9qk/AABSuSM23QOFVAe0SJ9oBIm6a?dl=0.
