# Code to Replicate Figures in "Scan-Specific Artifact Reduction in K-space (SPARK) Neural Networks Syngerize with Physics-based Reconstruction to Accelerate MRI" 

Written by Yamin Arefeen.  Please feel free to contact me and ask questions through email at yarefeen@mit.edu.

SPARK trains a convolutional-neural-network to estimate k-space errors made by an input reconstruction technique by back-propagating from the mean-squared-error loss between an auto-calibration signal (ACS) and the input techniqueâ€™s reconstructed ACS.  In this repository, we provide the code and data used to generate Figures 4-9.  The associated data for Figures 6-9 can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zveq2tfh7mgr9qk/AABSuSM23QOFVAe0SJ9oBIm6a?dl=0.  

Self-contained code and instructions to generate each of the figures can be found in the folders for each figure.

The dependencies of the conda enviornment used to run these experiments can be found in **requirements.txt** and can be used to create an identical enviornment to run experiments. 

## Figure 5: Pseudo-replica esque Technique for Evaluating SPARK and GRAPPA

Applies a process similar to the pseudo replica technique desribed in "Comprehensive Quantification of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and g-Factor for Image-Based and k-Space-Based Parallel Imaging Reconstructions" to compare GRAPPA and SPARK reconstructions on a single axial slice from an MPRAGE acquisition.

## Figure 6: Spark with LORAKS and VC GRAPPA

SPARK applied to LORAKS and virtual-coil GRAPPA on a single axial slice from an MPRAGE acquisition; demonstrating how SPARK synergizes with advanced 2D parallel imaging techniques.

## Figure 7: 3D SPARK with an Integrated ACS Region

Spark applied to a 3D GRE acquisition with undersampling in the phase-encode and partition-encode dimensions.  Assumes that the 3D GRE acquisition contains an integrated ACS region for SPARK training.

## Supporting Figure 8: 3D SPARK without an Integrated Acs Region

Spark applied to a 3D GRE acquisition with undersampling in the phase-encode and partition-encode dimensions.  Now, we asssume that our acquisition does not contain an integrated ACS region.  Instead, we assume that the ACS region has been under-sampled and reconstructing using GRAPPA kernels trained on some external reference scan.

## Figure 9: SPARK with 2D wave-encoding

Spark applied to a 2D wave-encoded and 2D-cartesian acquisition of an MPRAGE slice.

## Figure 10: SPARK with 3D wave-encoding

SPARK applied in a 3D wave-encoded setting.  With uniform-undersampling in the slice dimension, reconstructions are seperated and performed by slice-group.
